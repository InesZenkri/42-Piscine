 Here's a step-by-step guide for creating an SSH key, adding the public key to your repository, and updating the SSH key on the intranet:

Create Your SSH Key:

Open a terminal and run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:

bash command : ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

This command will prompt you to enter a file to save the key. Press Enter to use the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) or provide a custom path. You can also enter a passphrase for added security.

Add Your Public Key to Your Repository:

After creating the key, you need to add the public key to your repository.

Open the public key file with a text editor. The default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
bash command : cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the contents of the public key.

In your repository, create a file named id_rsa_pub and paste the public key into it.

Commit and push the changes to your repository.

Update Your SSH Key on the Intranet:
    Log in to the intranet or the platform where you manage your SSH keys.

Find the section for managing SSH keys.

Add a new SSH key, and paste the contents of your public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub).

Save the changes.

Now, your SSH key is associated with your repository, allowing you to push changes securely. Ensure that your local Git configuration uses the SSH URL for the repository (e.g., git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git). You should be able to push changes to the git server using your SSH key.

Important : Remember to keep your private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa) secure and never share it! The public key can be shared and associated with multiple services.
